# File Open Modes In Python

r    ==>     It opens a file for read only.

r+   ==>     It opens a file for read and write.

w    ==>     It allows write-level access to a file. If the file already exists, then it will get overwritten. It will create a new file if the same doesnâ€™t exist.

w+   ==>     It opens a file FOR write AND read

a    ==>     It opens the file in append mode.

a+   ==>     It opens a file FOR append AND read

rb   ==>     It opens a binary file for read
